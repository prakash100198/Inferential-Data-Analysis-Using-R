This project is dedicated to statistical inference analysis using t-distribution and p-values.  
For this project we will analyze the ToothGrowth dataset in R-studio. ToothGrowth is a dataset of tooth growth rate of guinea pigs when they were given 2 different type of Vitamin C - Orange Juice and Ascorbic Acid with three kinds of doses given to them 0.5mg/day,1mg/day and 2mg/day.  
  
We will study this dataset do some EDA and try to gain more insight and finally we will use t.test() function to test 4 hypothesis about tooth growth and end our discussion with a conclusion.
